# About
This app is created from the Python GUI library CustomTkinter and Tkinter that reads heart beat data from a Samsung Galaxy Watch. It can do live-time reading, data visualization, heart rate analysis, alert system, and data logging. It is not advisable to run this on public internet due to the unreliability to connect from the watch to computer via IP. 
# How to use
1. Download the HeartRateToWeb app from the Galaxy Store on your watch.
2. Launch main.py to determine your IP address and port.
3. Input the IP address and port in the format "http://ip.ad.re.ss.:port"
4. Wear the watch and wait until the the BPM changes from 0 to your recorded heart rate.
5. You are now ready to use the app.
