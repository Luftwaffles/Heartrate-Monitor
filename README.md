This app is created from the Python GUI library CustomTkinter and Tkinter that reads heart beat data from a Samsung Galaxy Watch. It can do live-time reading, data visualization, heart rate analysis, alert system, and data logging. It is not advisable to run this on public internet due to the unreliability to connect from the watch to computer via IP. This project is currently in development that will be implemented on and off due to school.
